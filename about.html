        <h4>Website Creator</h4>
        <p>When I was 11, I was diagnosed with Celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder that makes me allergic to
          gluten(wheat, rye barley). For years, I suffered as the Indian food I could make and eat outside gave me
          allergic reactions and could only stay away from the diet entirely. Over time, my family and I figured out
          what worked, what didn't, and successfully reintroduced South Asian foods into my diet. But many other South
          Asians with similar gluten intolerances and Celiac disease do not have access to this same support system or
          any resources about eating South Asian AND gluten free. So, I worked to create this website for my Girl Scout
          Gold Award Project, hoping to provide people with the support and resources they need.

    <p>As a Girl Scout Gold Award Project, this website specifically aims to be a sustainable (long-lasting) resource for gluten-free living. It is the highest award available, and marks the end of the Girl Scout journey for many Scouts. However, this website will remain available for anyone who needs it, and our team plans to continue developing and adding to the resource collection.</p>
