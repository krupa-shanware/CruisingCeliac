    <h3>Gluten in Spices (Masalas)
    </h3>
    <p>There have always been concerns that spice makers add flour to stretch out their spices and the outright incorrect information that silicon dioxide used to keep spices from clumping contains gluten.
    </p>
    <p>There has also been concern that cross contamination, perhaps from seasoning mixes that sometimes do contain gluten, might be a problem. Many of the big spice companies say outright that their pure spices are gluten free.
    </p>
    <p>Individual herbs and spices do not usually contain gluten. “seasonings” refers to a blend of spices and/or herbs, often combined with a carrier agent (e.g., salt, sugar, lactose, starches or flours) and an anti-caking agent. Blends of herbs and spices are sometimes combined with gluten-containing ingredients like wheat flour, wheat starch, wheat crumbs or wheat protein. These ingredients will be declared on the label of the seasoning blend.
    </p>
    <p>People with celiac disease and gluten sensitivities cannot eat gluten. This has led many people in the gluten-free community to wonder if their jars of spices contain only the spice in question or also “crumbs' of gluten as well.
    </p>
    <p>Let's discuss about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How to consider a spice or seasoning as gluten free</li>
        <li>A complete list of spice brands and each brand’s “gluten” claim</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>When do you consider Spice Gluten Free?</h3>
    <p>For a manufacturer to label a store-bought spice as “gluten free,” it cannot contain any gluten-containing ingredients, and it must contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten per the FDA’s gluten-free labeling guidelines. For a store-bought spice to be labeled “certified gluten-free,” it must be third-party verified to contain less than 20 ppm of gluten, and some certifying agencies even require stricter protocols, calling for a product to contain less than 10 ppm.
When you look at a spice jar and see only a single ingredient (i.e. basil), but don’t see a “gluten-free” disclosure, you may wonder if the spice is safe to consume. 
</p>
    <p>This is where things get tricky as gluten is known to not only lurk in surprise places, but also spices are notoriously coming in cross contact with gluten during the manufacturing process.</p>
    <p>Let's talk about Indian Masalas aka Spices:
</p>
    <p>Indian cuisine is full of flavourful and spicy food. India is the world's largest producer of spices. India is also the largest exporter and consumer of spices in the world. Most of the Indian masalas mix use multiple spices to create unique masala blends. However, the majority of the spices manufacturers may use wheat starch in spice powders to prolong shelf life. There is also a risk of contamination especially if the facility or equipment is shared for other gluten products. One of the major ingredients in many Indian Masalas is “Hing” aka “Asafetida”, it often contains wheat starch.
</p>
    <p>People with Celiac disease should buy Indian Masalas which are marked Gluten Free to avoid Risk Of Cross Contamination. Whole spices are however by default Gluten Free. List of Whole Spices used in Indian cooking: Cumin, Coriander, Black pepper, White Pepper, Red Chillies, Cardamom,Cinnamon,Cloves,Anise, Mace,Bay leaves, Fennel Seeds, Carom seeds, Dried Mango, Dried Ginger, Black Salt
