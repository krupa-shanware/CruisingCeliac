    <h1>Gluten-Free at Social Events</h1>
    
  </head>


  <main>
    <p>It can be pretty awkward to discuss your gluten-free options in a party of 10, 50 or 100+ people. But, it’s important that your health comes first. In this article, we’ll go over some ways to make sure you’re having fun and eating good food when you go to a friend’s house to eat.
    </p>
    <h4>Ask First</h4>
    <p>Always ask what will be at the party before you go. It’s surprising how often a friend will offer to make an accommodation, and you might even find out some of the food is already gluten-free. Don’t give up yet, a lot of foods are naturally gluten free! Of course, for South Asian food this is much less likely, but it never hurts to try it.
    </p>
    <h4>Bring Your Own</h4>
    <p>The easiest tip is simply to bring your own food. Let’s say you’re going to a birthday party with pizza and cake. Feel free to bring a gluten-free pizza, or some other alternative. You can also bring gluten-free cupcakes so you can also enjoy a dessert. If you find that some foods at your destination are gluten-free and some are not, you can always bring parts of your meal to sustain yourself. For example, if at a barbeque all the ingredients for the burger are gluten-free but the hamburger bun is not, bring your own buns!
    </p>
    <h4>Your Own Events</h4>
    <p>Inviting people over can also be made easier by having a mix of gluten and gluten-free food. For South Asian food, usually the meal consists of roti/chapati, rice, and various other dishes to go with them. There are many more specific diets according to region, but let’s go off of this simpler example. For your guests, you can make everything gluten-free except the rotis, and they’ll never notice! For the rotis, you can buy from local South Asian grocery stores such as India Cash and Carry or Rajot, or make wheat flour rotis if it works with your kitchen restrictions. This way, everyone can have amazing food and you can have everything gluten-free for yourself.
    </p>
    <h4>Work Events</h4>
    <p>For adults at work-related events, there’s usually some sort of party coordinator you can try to work with. If they are ordering from a restaurant, you can try to order something gluten-free or figure out if you can eat the food at all. If not, drinks are your best option. Getting on planning committees for such events is ideal, but of course a working lifestyle does not always allow that. If it is a smaller potluck, bringing a main entree that is gluten-free will ensure you have plenty to eat. 
</p>
    <h4>Working with Children</h4>
    <p>For children, do your best to educate your child on how dangerous exposure to gluten can be. Talk to the party host(the adult) as well, they can make sure your child does not have any unsafe foods and give them any gluten-free food you packed with your child. It is also possible that by talking to the host, they will find gluten-free options. Do your best to trust your child, drawing too much attention to the allergy can be upsetting and embarrassing, so trusting them to ask about food and make smart decisions about food is crucial.
</p>
    <h4>Gluten Sensors</h4>
    <p>To go the extra mile, bring a NIMA sensor or some similar sensor that can detect gluten in foods. Your child probably cannot partake in this until they get older, but at events you can use it to double check that a food item is safe to eat. Check out our articles section to read more about the NIMA sensor!
