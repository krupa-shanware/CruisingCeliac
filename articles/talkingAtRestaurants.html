    <h1>Talking about Gluten at Restaurants</h1>

    <h4>Being Realistic</h4>
    <p>Though the US has more awareness about celiac disease than many other foreign countries, it’s likely you will encounter people who do not know what the disease is and restaurants that may not accommodate you. Here are some tips for what you can do to make eating out safe:
    </p>
    <h4>Check Online First</h4>
    <p>Find Me Gluten Free is a great app and website to use, along with general google searches like “gluten-free near me.” The only issue is that many times, you won’t find ALL the options nearby and will miss a lot of great places. Another method is to find a cool restaurant first, and then go to their website. Places with gluten-free food usually indicate what is gluten free on their menus, and if they don’t, they are probably much more unreliable.
    </p>
    <h4>Call the Restaurant</h4>
    <p>Ask to speak with the manager if possible. It is possible that the restaurant simply does not list options on the menu, and speaking to trained personnel can help. Ask specifically about gluten-free options first, then about cross contamination issues. There are many restaurants that will accommodate for the first but not for the latter. Large chain restaurants are very likely to accommodate the first, but many times fast food chains cannot do the latter. Small businesses do not always have the bandwidth to accommodate either, and many small business personnel may not understand the allergy. In that case, the restaurant may simply not be an option.
    </p>
    <h4>Talk to the Wait Staff</h4>
    <p>Even if you called beforehand, your waiter needs to be made aware of your allergy so they can inform the kitchen if they provide accommodations. Many may assume it is a diet choice, so specify the allergy and explain that it is severe.
    </p>
    <h4>Research, Research, Research!</h4>
    <p>Do plenty of research when visiting other countries. Some may have plenty of options, but others may have little to none. Always make a list of available options near you on your trips, and be prepared for anything. It is always a good idea to get an Airbnb, hotel room with kitchen, or something similar to make sure you can make yourself food.
</p>
    <h4>Gluten Sensors</h4>
    <p>NIMA sensors and other similar gluten-detecting sensors can be helpful for cross-contamination in restaurants. It is likely though that eating out anywhere that is not fully gluten-free will have cross-contamination, so do not expect a great result every time. Check out our article about NIMA sensors to learn more!
