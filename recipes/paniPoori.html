    <p>Heat the oil to frying temperature, add 1 puri, and fry. The thickness of the puri should be so each puri should puff up round like a ball. If the puri does not puff then check the thickness of your puri. Take out fried puri in a big plate lined with paper towels to soak any extra oil.

    <p>Take out the mix in a bowl and add water to make it a liquid. Taste should be tangy, spicy and sweet.

    <p>Adjust spice with chillies as per your taste.
