    <!--types of Celiac disease-->
    <h4 class="sectionHead">It is possible to have Celiac disease and not feel symptoms. There are 3 types of the disease:
</h4>
    <p>Classical Celiac disease: patients have signs and symptoms of malabsorption, including diarrhea, steatorrhea (pale, foul-smelling, fatty stools), and weight loss or growth failure in children.
</p>
  <p>Non-classical celiac disease: patients may have mild gastrointestinal symptoms without clear signs of malabsorption or may have seemingly unrelated symptoms. They may suffer from abdominal distention and pain, and/or other symptoms such as: iron-deficiency anemia, chronic fatigue, chronic migraine, peripheral neuropathy (tingling, numbness, or pain in hands or feet), unexplained chronic hypertransaminasemia (elevated liver enzymes), reduced bone mass and bone fractures, and vitamin deficiency (folic acid and B12), difficulty losing weight, late menarche/early menopause and unexplained infertility, dental enamel defects, depression and anxiety, dermatitis herpetiformis (itchy skin rash), etc.
</p>
  <p>Silent celiac disease(asymptomatic celiac disease): Patients do not complain of any symptoms, but still experience villous atrophy damage to their small intestine. Studies show that even though patients thought they had no symptoms, after going on a strict gluten-free diet, they report better health and a reduction in acid reflux, abdominal bloating, and distention and flatulence.

  <!--steps to take in an ordered list-->
  <h1>Steps to Take</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Get diagnosed. Celiac can often be mistaken for other stomach issues that require much different treatment, so it’s important to make sure you know what you have. TTG( tissue transglutaminase IgA) blood tests and endoscopies are commonly used to diagnose.</li>
    <li>Connect with a dietician. If you are just starting out with Celiac, they can give you plenty of information on foods to avoid or embrace, even if it isn’t specific to your ethnic cuisine. It’s a great place to start and they can help you find potential spots for cross contamination. Gastroenterologists that specialize in nutrition may also be helpful.</li>
    <li>Don’t be afraid to seek help with your mental health. Celiac changes your entire lifestyle, and it’s perfectly normal to struggle. It’s important to put yourself first, and so if you feel like it would benefit you, look for a therapist to talk to.</li>
    <li>Continue getting TTG blood tests yearly after diagnosis. Celiac disease can cause long term damage to the lining of your digestive system, and you should routinely check if the damage has subsided. A good gluten-free diet will show results in the TTG test, and you can alter your diet according to how your blood test result changes over time. After being freshly diagnosed, you may be tested at a higher rate, but once your TTG test is at a safe level, once a year is a great routine.</li>
      </ol>
