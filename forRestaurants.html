    <h1>Restaurant Guide for Accommodating Gluten-Free Patrons</h1>

    <div class="generalInfo">
    <p>According to Food Allergy Canada, cross contamination is defined as when a small amount of a food allergen gets into another food accidentally through the manufacturing or food preparation process. Though this can happen at home, it is particularly of concern in restaurants where guests cannot see the cooking process. With gluten, found in many powders and flours, gluten-containing ingredients may find their way across a commercial kitchen into someone’s food. This isn’t a huge concern for those who choose gluten-free or have non-severe allergies, but for Celiacs and severe allergies this is a major issue. Ideally, eliminating all gluten is the goal, but in a restaurant, there are some ways to make gluten-free eating out safer without making the whole place GF.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="generalInfo">
    <h4 class="sectionHead">Here are some common issues with eating gluten-free, and how they can be resolved:</h4>
    </div>

    <div class="generalInfo">
      <h4 class="sectionHead">GF menus, in particular indicating on menu</h4>
    <p>The best and most important way to make eating out easier for those with gluten allergies is to simply list what can be made gluten free on the menu. This can be done with a simple indication of “GF,” or with a separate gluten free menu. In many cases, those with allergies are unsure whether they can go to a restaurant if menu items are not indicated online, so this step can help create more options.
</p>
    </div>

    <div class="generalInfo">
      <h4 class="sectionHead">Training staff for allergy requests</h4>
  <p>At many restaurants, particularly non-chain restaurants, it is common to see a lack of training in wait staff regarding allergies, especially if the menu is not marked with allergens. It is especially important that for the safety of patrons, gluten free items are marked and staff are trained on the exact accommodations that can be made. They should also be aware of possible risks with making any food gluten-free, such as shared fryers and ovens or unsafe ingredients.
</p>
    </div>

    <div class="generalInfo">
      <h4 class="sectionHead">Dedicated cooking areas</h4>
  <p>Pizza ovens and other shared cooking surfaces are often unsafe, as they do not get cleaned in between uses and thus, gluten and gluten-free items may be in close contact or even touch. Especially with fried items, gluten-free items may not be fried in the same oil as regular foods to be safe. So, the best fix is to separate an allergen friendly area. Additionally, changing gloves between these two areas will ensure less chances of cross-contamination. Businesses with similar practices include In-N-Out (separate fryers) and Chipotle (glove changing).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="generalInfo">
      <h4 class="sectionHead">Cross-contamination free prep</h4>
  <p>Another way that cross-contamination occurs is through using the same vessels and utensils to cook food. If the same pots and pans are used, they must be thoroughly washed with soap after use with gluten-containing ingredients. Any cast iron material cannot be effectively cleaned, so stick to stainless steel. Nonstick can be problematic if it is scratched, as cleaning may not remove residual buildup from the scratches. For utensils, only stainless steel and aluminum can be washed and used. Nonstick and wood materials are porous and cannot be cleaned effectively, like pots and pans of those materials. Baskin Robbins, for example, uses clean and washed scoops upon request.</p>
  <p>Of course, the ideal is that there are entirely separate vessels and utensils for gluten-free cooking for the utmost level of care. However, these steps will make eating much easier for those with allergies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="generalInfo">
      <h4 class="sectionHead">Safe ingredients</h4>
  <p>Small ingredients in cooking, especially ethnic cooking, such as spices, starches, and sauces may have hidden gluten. Be vigilant in checking that all of these items are certified gluten free. If not, they are not safe and should not be marketed as gluten free. In the past, restaurants such as BJs have been found to have marked gluten-free items on the menu that caused reactions and tested for cross-contamination. This could have been prevented by verification of safety with all ingredients, as well as how they were made.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="generalInfo">
  <p></p>
  <p>Making all of these changes is a huge effort, so be aware that making even small changes to accommodate patrons with allergies is a step in the right direction. In the event that your establishment wishes to make changes but is unsure where to start, please feel free to reach out for additional resources.
